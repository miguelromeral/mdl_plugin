Teachers can create exercises for students to upload their homework. The exercises consist of a brief title and a description of how the answers should be sent. Teachers can enable exercises so that students can upload their homework. The teacher can then download the work that his students have uploaded for the exercises and correct them in the way he considers appropriate. With these qualifications, a classification is completed among the students, corresponding to their work.

Among the characteristics of the module relating to users are:

* Upload files for each exercise.
* See global notes in a classification (in no case show sensitive information of other students).
* Download your own files that have uploaded.
* See the notes of exercises available or made by the student.

Teachers, on the other hand, will enjoy functions such as:

* See complete and restricted classification of students.
* Create, modify and eliminate exercises.
* Correct student assignments for each exercise.
* Make the notes visible or hidden.
* See individual notes for each exercise.
